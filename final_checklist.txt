- RE-READ EVERYTHING from the beginning to the end, the pdf and the incls, to ensure all is well.

Be quick about it and not perfectionnist. Treat this as if I had a deadline for yesterday.

- Try a few tricks like adding blank spaces to get nice page layouts if necessary (remember to clear the cache to check from scratch)

- Put the full release with pdf and incls on the Google Drive directory I'll share with the players.

- Put a copy of the full release and of the source code on my phone.

- Send to Jeanne, Dad and Zach (send them the Google Drive link)
