- RE-READ EVERYTHING from the beginning to the end, the pdf and the incls, to ensure all is well.
    LAST COMPLETED PAGE of the PDF file: 46
Be quick about it and not perfectionnist. Treat this as if I had a deadline for yesterday.
- Clarification to add : for Abilities that say "up to N tiles away", explain that a adjacent tile is 1 tile away already and that you cannot move diagonally for this (otherwise the targeting zone would be a square instead of a pseudo circle)
- Try a few tricks like adding blank spaces to get nice page layouts if necessary (remember to clear the cache to check from scratch)
- Put the full release with pdf and incls on the Google Drive directory I'll share with the players.

- Put a copy of the full release and of the source code on my phone.
- Send to Jeanne, Dad and Zach (send them the Google Drive link)
