# FINISHING THE MANUSCRIPT

- Finish the Lore. Be quick about it and not perfectionnist. Treat this as if I had a deadline for yesterday.
    LAST COMPLETED PAGE of the PDF file: 60

- Try a few tricks like adding blank spaces to get nice page layouts if necessary (remember to clear the cache to check from scratch)



# MAKING IT AVAILABLE

- Delete this final_checklist.txt file and any temporary file. Write the remaining steps somewhere of course :) so I can finish them.

- Put the full release with pdf and incls on the Google Drive directory I'll share with the players.
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q7WzfdtDhCEEnEun66uLDq3nrAE7gD7d

- Put a copy of the full release and of the source code on my phone.

- Send to Jeanne, all players in the group (post on whatsapp or discord) Dad and Zach (send them the Google Drive link)

- Send the players in Discord PMs the links to their character sheets and a new copy of the rules directoty, and explicitly tell them to BOOKMARK those, but addthat "although don't worry, I put reminders in the web app for those links. but still, bookmark! "
