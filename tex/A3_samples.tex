%%% IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
% - When formatting, ensure manually that the monsterbox below is not cut (on two columns or two pages), since LaTeX will not do it automatically. Move it or add spaces if needed.
% To modify the box template itself, see the files 'rpg-monster.sty' and 'rpg-strings.sty'

    Description of the Actor and token if possible. This description should be long enough so that the text goes below the token and wraps itself succesfully around it.

    More information should be presented, including tactical information. The token itself, obviously, is optional.

    \begin{rpg-monsteraction}[Senses]
    Any relevant Sense or Language beyond what is commonly expected can be also listed here.

    \rpgmonstersection{Notes}
    Optional. Any relevant note, such as the knowledge possessed by the Actor, roleplaying notes, advice about its intended combat behavior, maybe notes about possible variants of the Actor.

\end{monsterboxbg}


This Bestiary section will contain many standardized examples of Actors, ready for re-use.

Right above, I also present a template of "stat block", ready for modification and re-use: just look into the source code of the manuscript and see the implementation notes in the comments, or simply use it as a stylistic inspiration.

\begin{rpg-examplebox}
    Guidelines for the creation from scratch of custom Actors, as well as general balancing, are undissociable from general design considerations. As such, they are not presented here, but in section \ref{bestiary} instead. This part will instead contain only a catalog, and comments on the specific philosophy behind the design of the examples themselves, not of all Actors in general.
\end{rpg-examplebox}

The design considerations presented below also mean that Actors have, for instance, lower base damage and HP than would be the same for the players. As such, an easy way to scale these templates up when the players level up, so as to still match the guidelines, is to give them the equivalent of Tier 2 or Tier 3 equipment (or giving them objects that provide a similar boost in Aptitudes, Defenses and Damage).

\paragraph{Clarifications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Although they are not written on the stat block, all Actors presented here also have access to all standard Actions, (such as Concentrate or Assist) unless specified otherwise.
    \item In the "Abilities and Actions" section, everything with the words "Standard Attack" or "Action" in the title is assumed to be a regular Action (meaning it does not cost Focus) and everything else is assumed to be an Ability (which costs Focus), unless specified otherwise.
    \item Each Ability will mention in italics the Aptitude it uses, and if applicable, which Defense of the target to use as Difficulty ("vs")\footnote{If there is no "Versus", then the Difficulty is 0; this is usually made up for by having weaker effects or asking for another roll in the description of the Ability.}, or even the formula of a roll that must be passed to trigger it. If there is instead written "\textit{Always succeeds}", it means the effects as written in the description will always trigger without needing a roll.

    \rpgmonstersection{Notes}

    In the context of the "Knowledge Unending" Ability, to determine which Spells are known to a given Magister, you can draw from anywhere in this manuscript, depending on roleplaying context of course to inform your picks. For instance, it can be assumed they know all the Spellcaster archetype does, but feel free to draw Spells from any example given in the manuscript. Keep them reasonably balanced, for instance by downgrading Boss spells if you pick them.
    
    Furthermore, the second example included here (Nightmare) is an example of how Magisters have access to very powerful Spells, but feel free to design your own broken Abilities.

    \rpgmonstersection{Notes}
    This Boss has particulary high Defense values (and Accuracies to a lesser degree). As such, it is meant to be fought by players which have been boosted: they should regain some Heroism each turn, and use it to overcome this Boss.

    Note that the Abilities of the boss themselves are powerful, but not insanely so. The difficulty really comes from the modifiers.

\section{Examples of Abilities}

\label{examples}

This section presents example of Spells (in Table \ref{spells_example_table}), but also of Gadgets (in Table \ref{gadgets_example_table}) and Traits (in Table \ref{traits_example_table}). Those examples are here to be used as an inspiration when designing your own! As mentioned before, you can also \textbf{draw on the custom Abilities in the Bestiary above} for inspiration.

In those examples, to determine the duration of Conditions an INT of 3 and a target RES of 1 is assumed.

Some examples of uses that are different from a simple damage value or applied modifiers are presented, such as "Douse in Oil". We also present examples of different Objects created by achieving certain results when Crafting: for example, a a "Superior Ice Bomb" is obtained by a Critical Success when crafting an "Ice Bomb".

Those examples are useful to understand the construction and balancing of a Spell, or a custom Ability in general. For instance, consider "Unlife": in terms of expected effect, this is roughly the equivalent of being able to inflict 3 damage \texttimes 3 turns \texttimes 2 actions per turn \texttimes 0.5 from the hit probability, plus having a meatshield which will in effect prevent some HP damage to the PCs. This is slightly more powerful than other Abilities, but not much so, and is paid for by necessitating 6 Power Accents. As discussed before, always think in terms of \textbf{"how big of an impact does one use of this Ability have on the field of play"}.
